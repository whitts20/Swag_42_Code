Workflow Expectations:
1. Follow the naming structure of: ft_ before .c files, directory names will use all lower case letters and must only be the name of the relevant project (spaces will be represented with _).
2. Add, commit and push changes every hour, or when work is finished on a file.
3. When commiting, outline a clear process of what was changed in the file(s) in the commit message.
4. Make sure you are the only one working on a file at once, if not, discuss with the other person the changes you plan to make.
5. Only push to branches, never to the main.
